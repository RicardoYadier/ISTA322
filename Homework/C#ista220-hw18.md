##### 1. You are building a help ticket system. You want to ensure that the older the ticket, the sooner it will be handled by the team. For example, a ticket submitted a week ago has a higher priority than a ticked just submitted. What kind of data structure would you use, and why?
The Queue Data structure

##### 2. You are building a tracking system for seasonal agricultural farm labor. Te labor requirements vary widely, depending on the season. Your requirement is that the newest hires are terminated first, and that our more experienced hires are kept longer. What kind of data structure would you use, and why?
Stack Data structure

##### 3. You are building a transaction database. Your requirement is that the database adds data very quickly, and that deletions, updates, and searches happen infrequently. In other words, data is typically added in the order in which the transaction occurs. What kind of data structure would you use, and why?
List structure

##### 4. You are building an analytical database. Your requirement is that the database handle queries very quickly, but that the data never changes, i.e., there are no inserts, deletions, or updates. What kind of data structure would you use, and why?
Sorted List

##### 5. You are building a personnel directory, where searched are performed by last name, first name, middle name. What kind of data structure would you use, and why?

##### 6. You are building a username/password database. Your requirement is that updates happen frequently (when users change their passwords) and that searches (to authenticate users) happen extremely quickly. What kind of data structure would you use, and why?
Linked List

##### 7. What is a lambda expression? Give an example. Why would we use a lambda expression?
A lambda expression is an anonymous function that you can use to create delegates or expression tree types.

By using lambda expressions, you can write local functions that can be passed as arguments or returned as the value of function calls.

Lambda expressions are particularly helpful for writing LINQ query expressions.

##### 8. What is the difference between lambda expressions and anonymous methods? What are the advantages of each?
A lambda is simply an anonymous function - a function with no name. In C# Anonymous function is a general term that includes both lambda expressions and anonymous methods.

Provides a more succinct and natural syntax than anonymous methods, and they pervade many of the more advance aspects of C#.

Anonymous methods are delegate instances with no actual method declaration.

You can pass anonymous method as a parameter in place of a delegate
